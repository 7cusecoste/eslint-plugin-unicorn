The save game editor is a tool that can be downloaded from [Nexus Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomsofamalurreckoning/mods/10)[^1^]. It is a standalone application that does not require installation. To use it, players need to locate their save game files, which are usually found in Documents\My Games\Reckoning\Save or Documents\My Games\Re-Reckoning\Save. The save game files have names like Save\_0.sav or Save\_1.sav. Players can make a backup of their save game files before using the editor in case something goes wrong.
 
Once the save game editor is launched, players can open their save game file by clicking on File > Open. The editor will display a list of items in the inventory, categorized by type. Players can double-click on any item to change its properties, such as name, rarity, durability, effects, sockets, etc. Players can also add new items to their inventory by clicking on Edit > Add Item. A window will pop up where players can select an item from a list of categories and filters. Players can also modify their inventory size by clicking on Edit > Inventory Size.
 
After making the desired changes, players can save their modified save game file by clicking on File > Save. They can then load their save game file in the game and enjoy their customized items and inventory. The save game editor has some limitations and bugs, so players should use it at their own risk and follow the instructions on the Nexus Mods page[^1^]. The save game editor is a fun and useful tool for Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning fans who want to tweak their game experience.
  
## Some Tips and Tricks for Playing Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning
 
Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning is a vast and complex game that offers many possibilities for players to explore, fight, craft, and customize their characters. However, some aspects of the game may not be very clear or intuitive, especially for newcomers. Here are some tips and tricks that can help players get the most out of their adventure in Amalur.
 
- Save often. The game has an autosave feature, but it is not very reliable. It is recommended to manually save the game frequently, especially before entering a new area, completing a quest, or facing a tough enemy. This way, players can avoid losing progress or getting stuck in a bad situation.
- Use Reckoning Mode frequently. Reckoning Mode is a special ability that allows players to unleash devastating attacks and deal massive damage to enemies. It also slows down time and increases the chances of getting rare loot from enemies. To activate Reckoning Mode, players need to fill up their Fate meter by killing enemies or performing Fate Shift kills. Reckoning Mode can be a lifesaver in difficult battles or when facing multiple foes.
- Experiment with different play styles. The game does not lock players into a specific class or role. Players can mix and match skills from three different ability trees: Might, Finesse, and Sorcery. Each tree offers different weapons, spells, and abilities that suit different play styles. Players can also respec their skills at any Fateweaver for a fee. This allows players to try out different combinations and find the one that suits them best.
- Invest in useful skills. Besides combat skills, the game also offers various non-combat skills that can be very helpful in Amalur. Some of the most useful skills are:
    - Lockpicking: Allows players to open locked chests and doors that contain valuable loot or secrets.
    - Detect Hidden: Allows players to see hidden items, traps, lorestones, and enemies on the map.
    - Persuasion: Allows players to influence dialogues and get better rewards, information, or outcomes from NPCs.
    - Blacksmithing: Allows players to craft and improve their own weapons and armor from components they find or salvage.
    - Sagecraft: Allows players to create and socket gems that enhance their equipment with various effects.
- Maintain your equipment. Weapons and armor degrade over time and use, reducing their effectiveness and value. Players can repair their equipment at any blacksmith or by using repair kits they find or buy. Repairing equipment regularly can save money and ensure optimal performance in combat.
- Explore the world. Amalur is a huge and diverse world that offers many places to see, quests to do, secrets to find, and enemies to fight. Players should not rush through the main story, but take their time to explore the different regions, factions, lorestones, dungeons, and side quests. Exploring can also reward players with experience, loot, reputation, achievements, and fun.
